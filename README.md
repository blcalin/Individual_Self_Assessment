# Individual_Self_Assessment

## Self-Assessment
* Contributed to final project by reviewing code in Jupyter Notebook, creating the initial presentation slides, and assisting other group members with additions to README and dashboard composition.
* By contributing to various aspects of the project, I was able to help other group members with a variety of tasks while mastering my analytical skills during the process. Maintaining a positive attitude, discussing any troubleshooting throughout the process, and reviewing others' work helped make for a successful group and project.
* My greatest personal challenge was having the confidence to utilize the information learned in the course and applying it in a group setting. With various opinions and people, at times it felt difficult to be able to speak up and contribute using my knowledge without feeling overwhelmed in a group setting. I was able to overcome this by taking time ahead of each work session to write down any thoughts/opinions I had to make for a more productive working session.

## Team Assessment
* Team communication was done primarily through Slack, both over chat and video sessions. Class time over Zoom was used to coordinate and commmunicate among members, supplemented with meeting outside of class over video where necessary. Challenges included coordinating schedules to best suit everyone, and ensuring that each individual had given tasks ahead of the following week. Next time, instead of planning what needed to be accomplished later in the week, it would be beneficial to plan tasks earlier in the week to be as productive as possible.
*Team strengths included communication skills, helping other group members, and ensuring each member was equally involved in the project.
* Tips to share with a new cohort kicking off the project include time management, proper communication with team members, and utilizing class time as much as possible in order to have assistance from other team members/instructors/TAs as possible.

## Summary of Project
Tjhis project analyzes the features of mushrooms in order to determine if they hold insight into whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous. Using Python/Jupyter Notebook, data was split into training and testing samples using "train_test_split" from sklearn. Data was scaled using the StandardScaler, and created/trained the Random Forest Classifier model to make predictions on the dataset, and determine the accuracy of the model. Based on our analysis, there was a high accuracy score of over 90%, signifying that our features are great predictors of our classes.
